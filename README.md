## About

Welcome to the ProtecIoTnet repository! ProtecIoTnet is a web-based python application developed to support users in securely utilizing IoT devices in a home network. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface, catering to both novice and experienced users, while addressing a wide range of identified risks associated with IoT devices in home networks. Currently supported are IP-, ZigBee-, Bluetooth- and BLE-based products.

### Key Features

- Open source development in python using the Flask web framework
- Assist users in identifying and mitigating potential risks through automated and repeatable tests
- Leverages existing open-source software for detection and attack simulations wherever possible
- Detects and gathers comprehensive information about IoT devices in the network
- Developed for Raspberry Pi 4 as a cost-effective and highly supported open-source platform
- Supports common Smart Home standards, including Wi-Fi, MQTT, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low Energy
- Intuitive web interface for setting parameters, displaying results, and managing modules
- Modular design to encapsulate tests and attacks, enabling easy integration of additional modules
- Stores output in a single SQLite database for easy accessibility and compatibility

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 4b (or a similar single-board computer) with sufficient memory and processing power
- Raspbian or another compatible operating system installed on the Raspberry Pi
- Internet connection to access the web-based application and update dependencies
- RaspBee II
- Ubertooth One

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/hweckermann/proteciotnet

# Go into the repository
$ cd proteciotnet

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
$ python3 proteciotnet.py --start-server
```

The application will now start on the local server. If the browser doesn't open automatically , please open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.


## Usage

```bash
# Starting the server 
$ python3 proteciotnet.py --start-server

# Starting the server with verbose output
$ python3 proteciotnet.py --start-server -v

# Printing the version
$ python3 proteciotnet.py -V
```
